<p>Red Dirt music is my favorite even though I have never lived in Texas. But I have a Georgia, Illinois, California, and Idaho influence that is rural in nature making Texas music a natural fit for my style. I love story songs and songs with a lot of cowboy, farmer, and youthful feel. I look forward to bringing your venue more than just music but a life style with more stories!</p>
<p>My shows are about more than music. I like to tell stories about life, life on the road, country livinâ€™ and sometimes out right lies that are funny. Everyday we should find something to smile about so I bring a lot of that with me to the stage!</p>
